# Configure

Provides an object that allows easy access to data that gets
passed around my code.

This is potentially a really bad mutable singleton idea but does allow neater
 looking code if used carefully and can removes a heap of boilerplate type
 coding for the common things I do and use by bringing together a bunch of
 functionallity I have create such as database connectivity and
 argument parsing.
